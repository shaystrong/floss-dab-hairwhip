# Floss! Dab! Hair whip!

This app uses a <a href='https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/'>Teachable Machine</a>
Tensorflow model in the browser to predict, using your pose in the webcam, whether you are doing the floss, dab, or hair whip. If you are doing the Dab (> 0.6 confidence), you get a 🍓. If you are flossing (> 0.6 confidence), you get a 😍. If you are doing a hair whip (> 0.6 confidence), you get a 🐼.
